# VFS for Git (GitHub partial development fork only)

This repository contains work-in-progress by GitHub's engineering team on the [VFS for Git](https://vfsforgit.org/) client.  All work here will be contributed to the upstream [Microsoft/VFSForGit](https://github.com/Microsoft/VFSForGit) repository.

We advise anyone interested in VFS for Git to fork or follow the [Microsoft/VFSForGit](https://github.com/Microsoft/VFSForGit) repository instead of this one, as this repository is only a partial clone of the full upstream repo and furthermore may not be regularly updated with the latest changes.

Thank you for your interest in VFS for Git!
